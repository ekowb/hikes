One-to-Many: Peaks Around the World

Instructions:

Youâ€™ve been tasked with building a new app, the app will need to have two separate models:

- Mountains
- Climbers

The data will have the following relationship:

- A climber belongs to a mountain
- A mountain has many climbers

- Build out the associations for the models.

- For our index page for Climbers, a user should be able to click on a specific climber and take them to the corresponding show page.

- The Climber show page should have their name, age, country, mountain and link to the Mountain show page.

- The Mountain show page should have their name, height, location and the list of climbers they are connected to.

- For our index page for Mountains, a user should be able to click on a specific Mountain and take them to their corresponding show page.

- As a user, I should be able to create AND edit a Climber, and only be able to select 1   mountain from a list of already existing mountains.

- Make sure user fills in all of the fields.
